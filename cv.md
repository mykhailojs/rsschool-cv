### Code example:
**Remove First and Last Character from CODEWARS:** It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry about strings with less than two characters.
```js
function removeChar(str) {
  return str.slice(1, -1);
}
```
